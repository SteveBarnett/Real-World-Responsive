# Real World Responsive

Not just another viewport tester. A reminder of real world conditions of screens.

## The Problem

There are **a lot** of tools for [testing responsive sites](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#viewport-testing).

Most of them just give you a way of showing a site at different viewport sizes. Some of them use devices (or "mobile" and "desktop") as the viewport sizes, reinforcing the idea that we're designing for specific devices, not for fluid, ever-changing, screen resolutions where we base our breakpoints on the content.

They also don't touch on what happens when you view sites on devices in the real world: outside the office! Screens are faded, blurry, or cracked. Browser capabilities vary (sometimes wildly) across different devices. Ideally, we'd use an [Open Device Lab](http://opendevicelab.com/) to test our work on real devices, but that's not always possible.

## The Solution

**Real World Responsive** is a tool that helps us remember that our designs won't always be viewed in great conditions or on new or high-powered devices.
